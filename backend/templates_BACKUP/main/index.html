            <p>
              Russian aggression against Ukraine is the largest conflict in
              Europe since World War II. Animals are living in constant danger —
              exposed to hunger, daily explosions, stress and cold. Thousands of
              pets have lost their owners and live on strits now. Many animals
              were left behind during evacuation, while others were already
              living on the streets. There are multiple evidence of sadists
              actions towards Ukraiinan animals done by Russian soldiers.
              Internet is full of blurring videos and photos. By supporting
              animals from war zones you give these poor souls a chance to live.

          <h1>THIS WEBSITE WAS CREATED BY VOLUNTEERS AND ANIMAL LOVERS</h1>

          <p>
            At least 140 000 dogs and cats in Ukraine need homes or ongoing
            care. We who want to make pet adoption and animal transport clearer,
            safer, and more achievable.
          </p>

          <p>
            This website was built by volunteers who care deeply about animals
            affected by war and displacement. It has been four years since
            Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Many regions of
            Ukraine are under daily shelling and missile attacks.
          </p>

          <p>
            As people are forced to flee the country, many must leave their pets
            behind. Thousands of pet owners have been killed, and countless
            animals are left on the streets to survive alone. There is little to
            no food, constant danger from explosions, and extreme conditions.
            During harsh Ukrainian winters, temperatures can drop to −20°C,
            leaving animals exposed to freezing cold, bombs, and ongoing
            destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to raise awareness about animal ongoing crisis in
            Ukraine. Animal shelters across Ukraine are severely overcrowded
            with cats and dogs. Many families already care for three, five, or
            even more animals in their own homes, yet this is still not enough
            to provide safe and loving families for all animals in need. Animals
            are often temporarily sheltered in public places such as shops,
            bacements, and underground stations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Ukrainian cities or part of cities do not exixt anymore. People
            lost their homes, jobs, moved to other countries or regions within
            Ukraine trying to cope with their own war situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless reports confirmed. Whereever Russian army is present,
            animals are suffering the most, including being tortured. Evidence
            of animal cruelty by Russian soldiers keeps emerging. Animals are
            being used as bait, shot, burned alive, and killed in horrific ways.
            Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv, Borodyanka are just some of the
            cities wherene such atrocities have been already reported. With
            every passing day, more evidence comes to light. If Russian manage
            to occupy more territories, more innocent animals will suffer the
            same fate.

          <h1>WHO CAN FIND THIS WEBSITE HELPFUL</h1>

          <p>
            This website is for people from different parts of the world who
            want to adopt animals from war zone like Ukraine, as well as for
            Ukrainians who need guidance on how to travel safely with their own
            pets.
          </p>

          <p>
            We bring together essential documents, trusted contacts, and real
            examples in one place. Many animals are left behind during
            evacuations, and this platform focuses on practical steps, not just
            stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this website, we also aim to draw greater attention from
            animal protection organisations and encourage them to speak more
            openly and consistently about the animal crisis in Ukraine. This is
            a humanitarian and environmental tragedy that our planet has not
            witnessed on this scale for decades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Human life is vital — and animal life matters too. We hope to
            inspire and engage more people who have the influence to elevate the
            animal crisis in Ukraine to the highest level of attention, working
            through organisations that may not be able to end the war, but can
            help reduce the suffering of animals caught in it.
