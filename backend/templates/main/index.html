            <p>
              Russian aggression against Ukraine is the largest conflict in
              Europe since World War II. Animals are living in constant danger —
              exposed to hunger, daily explosions, stress and cold. Thousands of
              pets have lost their owners and live on streets now. Many animals
              were left behind during evacuation, while others were already
              living on the streets. There is evidence of cruel actions toward
              Ukrainian animals done by Russian soldiers. By supporting animals
              from war zones you give these poor souls a chance to live.

          <h1>THIS WEBSITE WAS CREATED BY VOLUNTEERS AND ANIMAL LOVERS</h1>

          <p>
            At least 140,000 dogs and cats in Ukraine need homes or ongoing
            care. We want to make pet adoption and animal transport clearer,
            safer, and more achievable.
          </p>

          <p>
            This website was built by volunteers who care deeply about animals
            affected by war and displacement. It has been four years since
            Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Many regions of
            Ukraine are under daily shelling and missile attacks.
          </p>

          <p>
            As people are forced to flee the country, many must leave their pets
            behind. Thousands of pet owners have been killed, and countless
            animals are left on the streets to survive alone. There is little to
            no food, constant danger from explosions, and extreme conditions.
            During harsh Ukrainian winters, temperatures can drop to −20°C,
            leaving animals exposed to freezing cold, bombs, and ongoing
            destruction.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would like to raise awareness about the ongoing animal crisis in
            Ukraine. Animal shelters across Ukraine are severely overcrowded
            with cats and dogs. Many families already care for three, five, or
            even more animals in their own homes, yet this is still not enough
            to provide safe and loving families for all animals in need. Animals
            are often temporarily sheltered in public places such as shops,
            basements, and underground stations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some Ukrainian cities or parts of cities do not exist anymore.
            People lost their homes and jobs and moved to other countries or
            regions within Ukraine, trying to cope with their own war situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Countless reports confirm that wherever the Russian army is present,
            animals suffer the most, including being tortured. Evidence of
            animal cruelty keeps emerging. Animals are being used as bait, shot,
            burned alive, and killed in horrific ways. Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin,
            Kharkiv, and Borodyanka are just some of the cities where such
            atrocities have already been reported.

          <h1>WHO CAN FIND THIS WEBSITE HELPFUL</h1>

          <p>
            This website is for people from different parts of the world who
            want to adopt animals from a war zone like Ukraine, as well as for
            Ukrainians who need guidance on how to travel safely with their own
            pets.
          </p>

          <p>
            We bring together essential documents, trusted contacts, and real
            examples in one place. Many animals are left behind during
            evacuations, and this platform focuses on practical steps, not just
            stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this website, we also aim to draw greater attention from
            animal protection organisations and encourage them to speak more
            openly and consistently about the animal crisis in Ukraine.
          </p>

          <p>
            Human life is vital — and animal life matters too. We hope to
            inspire and engage more people who have the influence to elevate the
            animal crisis in Ukraine to the highest level of attention.
