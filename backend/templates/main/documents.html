        <h2 class="labs-title">UKRAINE - ANIMAL ADOPTION PROCESS</h2>

        <p>
          War paws are not simply living safely on the streets or waiting in
          shelters for adoption — they are exposed to constant danger and
          stress. At any moment, they can be injured or killed by shelling,
          explosions, or direct attacks from the Russian army. By choosing to
          help or adopt, you are not only offering compassion — you are offering
          safety and a chance at life. Please don’t be discouraged — the
          adoption process is not as difficult as it may seem at first,
          especially with the support of dedicated volunteers and animal lovers
          across Ukraine.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1)</strong> Select a Shelter: Choose from the list we have or
          find one yourself. Ensure they are willing to handle the rigorous
          international paperwork. Most of them are willing to help with it,
          especially if they have a cat or dog they cannot find a family for a
          long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2)</strong> Verify Approved Importer Status: To commercially
          import a pet from Ukraine, the UK/EU-based importer (you or a rescue
          organisation) must have Approved Importer status from the Animal and
          Plant Health Agency (APHA). Visit
          <strong>
            <a
              href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-pets-into-the-uk-animal-health-requirements"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >UK Government website</a
            >
          </strong>
          for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3)</strong> Arrange Approved Transport: The cat/dog must
          travel via an approved route (e.g., Eurotunnel or Dover if coming to
          the UK) and enter as manifested cargo if flying. If you want to use a
          plane, please note that unfortunately you cannot bring a commercial
          animal in the cabin if you are flying to the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4)</strong> Obtain Documentation: Pet Health Certificate:
          Issued by an Official Veterinarian in Ukraine within 48 hours of
          departure for commercial movements. IPAFFS Notification: You must
          notify APHA about the import through the IPAFFS system at least one
          working day before arrival.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>5)</strong> Unlike refugees, British/European adopters must
          pay all costs:
        </p>
        <p>Veterinary Prep (Ukraine): ~3,500 – 6,000 UAH (£65 – £115).</p>
        <p>
          Transport (EU to UK): £300 – £1,500 for professional road transport.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6)</strong> Mandatory Medical Prep (Same as Travel):</p>
        <p>- Microchip: Must be done first.</p>
        <p>- Rabies Vaccination: Must be recorded in the passport.</p>
        <p>
          - Titer Test: A blood sample must be taken at least 30 days after
          vaccination and sent to an EU-approved lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If you live in the United Kingdom, your pet should wait 3 calendar
          months in Ukraine since the blood was drawn before it could enter the
          country. The EU has different rules and in many cases they are easier
          for pet adoption from Ukraine. Please check with your local
          authorities.

        <h2 class="labs-title">COSTS IN PET ADOPTION FROM UKRAINE</h2>

        <p>
          There are animals that are already spayed and had basic vet check-ups,
          but some of them still need to go through full medical preparation.
          Volunteers prioritise finding new pet parents locally in Ukraine, but
          there are always animals they struggle to rehome inside the country.
          Sometimes volunteers decide to find a new forever home in Europe or
          the UK. The most common reasons why some animals cannot travel abroad
          are lack of funding for medical preparation and transportation, or
          because the animal is too old or has health issues that make travel
          unsafe.
        </p>

        <p>
          To meet international travel standards, the following procedures must
          be completed in Ukraine.
        </p>

        <p>
          A full preparation package generally costs between 3,000 UAH and
          10,000 UAH (£60–£200).
        </p>
        <p>- Microchipping: 500–700 UAH (£10–£14).</p>
        <p>- Rabies Vaccination: 150–300 UAH (£3–£6).</p>
        <p>
          - Rabies Antibody Titer Test: 2,500 UAH (£50) for standard service;
          5,000 UAH (£100) for urgent results.
        </p>
        <p>- European Standard Passport: 50–400 UAH (£1–£8).</p>
        <p>
          - Final Export Certificates: Form 1-VET (state vet) costs up to 50 UAH
          (£1).
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, volunteers try to help as much as they can by taking animals
          to vets as many times as needed and finding ways to transport animals
          safely within Ukraine so they can reach the border with EU countries.

            Rabies antibody titration tests (FAVN / RFFIT ≥ 0.5 IU/ml), required
            for travel to the EU and the UK, are performed only by EU-designated
            laboratories. Veterinary clinics in other cities collect blood
            samples and send them to authorised laboratories, usually located in
            Kyiv. Prices, timelines and availability may change. Always confirm
            requirements directly with the clinic, laboratory, and destination
            country authorities.

              Does my future pet have a passport for travelling abroad?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              In most cases, no. Around 99% of animals do not initially have
              travel documents. However, this is not a problem. Depending on the
              city where the animal is located, we provide information about
              local veterinary clinics and organisations where you can arrange:
              medical examinations, vaccinations, blood tests, microchipping,
              and the travel passport.

              How can I pay for veterinary appointments in Ukraine?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              There are two common options: Option 1: You choose and agree on a
              clinic together with the volunteer. The clinic provides its bank
              details, and you pay the clinic directly. Option 2: The volunteer
              arranges and pays for the appointment and sends receipts. You then
              transfer the money to the volunteer.

              No. In most cases, volunteers can organise everything on your
              behalf. However, if you want to be fully involved, you may choose
              to travel to a safer region, usually in western Ukraine, once your
              pet has a passport and is ready to travel.

              Are there any issues with pet travel documents?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              Sometimes, yes. Many animals have been traumatised by war. In some
              cases, veterinarians do not recommend long-distance travel,
              especially if the animal is very anxious or has health issues.

              Are there fraudulent situations involving animals in Ukraine?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              Unfortunately, yes — not everyone claiming to be an animal rescuer
              truly is. That’s why we recommend checking social media profiles,
              activity history, and whether receipts and reports are regularly
              posted.

              I’m worried about the language barrier. Do volunteers speak
              English?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              Some organisations have English-language websites, and some
              volunteers speak or understand basic English. Instagram often
              auto-translates posts and comments. Google Translate works well
              for messages.

            <h3 class="qa-q">
              How long does it take to get a travel passport?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              It depends on clinic and volunteer availability. Travel passport
              around 2 weeks. Full preparation for international travel can take
              up to 3 months, depending on destination requirements.

              Is a Ukrainian animal passport valid for all countries?
            </h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              No. Each country has different entry requirements. Ensure the
              animal meets the rules of your destination country.

            <h3 class="qa-q">Can I choose the transport company?</h3>
            <p class="qa-a">
              Yes. You can discuss transport options with the volunteer. Some
              volunteers prefer specific transport companies they trust.

            <p class="qa-a">
              Consider shelters in western Ukraine closer to borders, collect
              the animal from the EU side of the border, and compare prices from
              multiple transport companies.
